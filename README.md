# FAVS API
*Favs* is a new company that aims to provide a better way to organize your favorite things: music, clothes, courses, etc., all in one place.
## Endpoints
### Create Users
To create a new user, send a POST http request to `/api/users` with the user's information in the following json structure:
```json
{
    "email":"user email",
    "password": "user password"
}
```
Password should contain at least a number and a capital letter. If the password does not comply with these requirements, server will return following message:
```json
{
    "message": "Password is not strong enough. Remember to include at least a capital letter and a number."
}
```
User's email should not be already included in the database. Otherwise, server will return an **error 500**.

### Users' Login

For users to login, send a POST http request to `/auth/local/login` with the user's information in the following json structure:
```json
{
    "email":"user email",
    "password": "user password"
}
```
If user is not registered in the database, server will return an error 404 with the following json message:

```json
{
    "message": "User not found"
}
```

If password is not the same as user registered, server will return an error 404 with the following json message:
```json
{
    "message": "Invalid password"
}
```
If login is successful, server will return a status 200 with the following json message:
```json
{
    "profile": {
        "_id": "user's unique id",
        "email": "user's email"
    },
    "userToken": "autogenerated user's access token"
}
```
