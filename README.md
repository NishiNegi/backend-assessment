## Endpoints

### Create Users

To create a new user, send a POST http request to `/api/users` with the user's information in the following json structure:

```json
{
  "email": "user email",
  "password": "user password"
}
```

Password should contain at least a number and a capital letter. If the password does not comply with these requirements, server will return following message:

```json
{
  "message": "Password is not strong enough. Remember to include at least a capital letter and a number."
}
```

User's email should not be already included in the database. Otherwise, server will return an **error 500**.

### Users' Login

For users to login, send a POST http request to `/auth/local/login` with the user's information in the following json structure:

```json
{
  "email": "user email",
  "password": "user password"
}
```

If user is not registered in the database, server will return an error 404 with the following json message:

```json
{
  "message": "User not found"
}
```

If password is not the same as user registered, server will return an error 404 with the following json message:

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid password"
}
```

If login is successful, server will return a status 200 with the following json message:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "_id": "user's unique id",
    "email": "user's email"
  },
  "userToken": "autogenerated user's access token"
}
```

### Lists

#### Create a list

For users to create a new list, send a POST http request to `/api/lists` with the list's name in the following json structure:

```json
{
  "name": "list name"
}
```
Remember that only users who have logged in can create their own lists. That is why you must include the [token provided on the login](#users-login) in the request headers. If token is not included, or is not correct, server will send an error message as follow:
```json
{
    "message": "invalid user token"
}
```

If creation is successful, server will return a status 200 with the following json message:

```json
{
  "name": "list name",
  "items": [],
  "_id": "list id",
  "createdAt": "creation date",
  "updatedAt": "creation date",
  "__v": 0
}
```

### Favs

#### Create a fav item

For users to create a new fav item, send a POST http request to `/api/favsd` with the list's name in the following json structure:

```json
{
  "title": "title of the item",
  "description": "description of the item",
  "link": "link for the item"
}
```

`title` and `description` are required, but link can be absent of the previous format.

If creation is successful, server will return a status 200 with the following json message:

```json
{
  "title": "title of the item",
  "description": "description of the item",
  "link": "link for the item",
  "_id": "item id",
  "createdAt": "creation date",
  "updatedAt": "creation date",
  "__v": 0
}
```
